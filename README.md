### Heapsort using max heap

While running the heap sort that used max heapify function, the average time it took to sort an empty array was 0.0000 seconds, sort the already sorted array of size 500000 was 1.472095 seconds, reverse sorted array of size 500000 was 1.375182 seconds and randomly sorted array of size 500000 was 1.726767 seconds.

### Priority queue using min-heap

The priority queue was implemented for a class named "Tasks" which had parameters id, priority, arrivalTime, deadline. As the priority queue was implemented using a min-heap, the tasks which had the lowest priority were the ones that were popped first.
